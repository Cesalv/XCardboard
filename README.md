XCardboard is a hybrid app for Google's Cardboard based on Apache Cordova and developed with the Intel XDK. 
Currently you can view 360° panorama pictures with the Google Cardboard glasses. 
But the XCardboard app is not only confined on this function. 
Like the original Cardboard app for Android, we can implement and improve more features.

### What is Google's Cardboard?

The Google Cardboard are virtual reality glasses made of? Exactly, it’s made of cardboard. 
The box is easy to build and a magnetic ring provides the necessary stability. 
In combination with a Smartphone, the Cardboard is offering you the ultimate virtual reality expierience. 
The box is designed in a way, so the Smartphone can be placed in it without falling out. 
A Velcro closure, as well as an ordinary rubber band provides a firm hold. 
With biconvex-lenses by Google and by using special apps, 
you can transform the screen of your phone to a fascinating, 3D VR display.

### What is the motivation behind XCardboard
 
There are only Cardboard apps for Android. The reason is that only Google API for Android offers a native Cardboard. 
We as Windows phone users were disappointed about it so we decide to put an end to it and have built a hybrid app. 
A further motivation was to show, what’s possible with HTML5, JavaScript and Apache Cordova. 
It was also very important to us, to provide the source code, so that anyone who would like to develop something for cardboard, 
can learn it in our project on GitHub. Our open source project is governed by the MIT license.

### Used technologies

- Apache Cordova (developed with the free Intel XDK)
- AngularJS
- Twitter bootstrap
 
Installation
--- 
The app will be published in the different stores soon. We will also publish the exact links to the respective platforms. Who wants to try the app on your own device right now, requires the free app named Intel app Preview. Which is available in every store. If the app is installed you just need to scan the following QR code or open the following [link](https://appcenter.html5tools-software.intel.com/mobile/aptest.aspx?APP=7_aiEV8BuyTTCe1JgO4qeP2l-bGmP-xL8In__zi0U_M&PASS=&PKG=QA&REL=4.0.0&SVR=https://appcenter.html5tools-software.intel.com/) on your Smartphone:
